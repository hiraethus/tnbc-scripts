# tnbc-scripts

Scripts to help in retrieving multiomic data about triple-negative
breast cancer

## TODO

* An R script that takes all TNBC data from TCGA and tries to do
hierarchical clustering on differential gene expression data

* Do hierarchical clustering following differential expression
analysis using survival curves as the predictive variable then perform
hierarchical clustering

* Think about testing to see if these groups are significantly
different and

* Create Query Gene Signatures from each of thes subtypes
